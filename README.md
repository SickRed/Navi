### Navigation Algorithms with GUI
This little Project was created as an example for pathfinding algorithms.
* Breadth-first search - Algortihm [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search]
* Depth-first search - Algortith [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search]
* Closest range search - Algortitm (I actually forgot what I implemented there, sorry)

I created this in early learners phase, so don't expect too much. It's pretty GUI-driven,
if you're just interested in the pathfinding algorithms you're fine by ignoring anything but the Graph.java
Also it's commented and labeled german, i still hope this might become handy for someone.

Cheers

#### Für die deutschsprachigen Suchmaschinen-Nutzer
Dieses Projekt dient der Veranschaulichung von Pfadfindungs-Algorithmen in Java.
* Tiefensuche - Algortihm [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search]
* Breitensuche - Algortith [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search]
* Kürzester Weg

Die für die Pfadfindung relevanten Methoden finden sich in der Graph.java, die verbleibenden Klassen dienen
der Darstellung bzw. dem Handling der GUI
